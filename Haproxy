--NI =	N : the client provided NO cookie. This is usually the case for new visitors, so counting the number of occurrences of this flag in the
            logs generally indicate a valid trend for the site frequentation.
	I : no cookie was provided by the server, and the proxy INSERTED one. Note that in "cookie insert" mode, if the server provides a cookie,
            it will still be overwritten and reported as "I" here.

--VN =	V : the client provided a VALID cookie, and was sent to the associated server.
	N : NO cookie was provided by the server, and none was inserted either.

cD = 	c : the client-side timeout expired while waiting for the client to
            send or receive data.
        D : the session was in the DATA phase.

LRNN =	L : the session was locally processed by haproxy and was not passed to a server. This is what happens for stats and redirects.
	R : the proxy was waiting for a complete, valid REQUEST from the client (HTTP mode only). Nothing was sent to any server.
	N : the client provided NO cookie. This is usually the case for new visitors, so counting the number of occurrences of this flag in the
            logs generally indicate a valid trend for the site frequentation.
	N : NO cookie was provided by the server, and none was inserted either.
