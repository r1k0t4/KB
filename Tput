Text Effects
Like the capnames used for cursor manipulation, the following capnames output strings of control codes that affect the way our terminal displays text characters:

Text effects capnames
Capname	Description
bold	Start bold text
smul	Start underlined text
rmul	End underlined text
rev	Start reverse video
blink	Start blinking text
invis	Start invisible text
smso	Start “standout” mode
rmso	End “standout” mode
sgr0	Turn off all attributes
setaf <value>	Set foreground color
setab <value>	Set background color
Some capabilities, such as underline and standout, have capnames to turn the attribute both on and off while others only have a capname to turn the attribute on. In these cases, the sgr0 capname can be used to return the text rendering to a “normal” state. Here is a simple script that demonstrates the common text effects:

    #!/bin/bash

    # tput_characters - Test various character attributes

    clear

    echo "tput character test"
    echo "==================="
    echo

    tput bold;  echo "This text has the bold attribute.";     tput sgr0

    tput smul;  echo "This text is underlined (smul).";       tput rmul

    # Most terminal emulators do not support blinking text (though xterm
    # does) because blinking text is considered to be in bad taste ;-)
    tput blink; echo "This text is blinking (blink).";        tput sgr0

    tput rev;   echo "This text has the reverse attribute";   tput sgr0

    # Standout mode is reverse on many terminals, bold on others. 
    tput smso;  echo "This text is in standout mode (smso)."; tput rmso

    tput sgr0
    echo
tput_characters
tput_characters
Text Color
Most terminals support 8 foreground text colors and 8 background colors (though some support as many as 256). Using the setaf and setab capabilities, we can set the foreground and background colors. The exact rendering of colors is a little hard to predict. Many desktop managers impose “system colors” on terminal windows, thereby modifying foreground and background colors from the standard. Despite this, here are what the colors should be:

Text colors
Value	Color
0	Black
1	Red
2	Green
3	Yellow
4	Blue
5	Magenta
6	Cyan
7	White
8	Not used
9	Reset to default color
The following script uses the setaf and setab capabilities to display the available foreground/background color combinations:

    #!/bin/bash

    # tput_colors - Demonstrate color combinations.

    for fg_color in {0..7}; do
        set_foreground=$(tput setaf $fg_color)
        for bg_color in {0..7}; do
            set_background=$(tput setab $bg_color)
            echo -n $set_background$set_foreground
            printf ' F:%s B:%s ' $fg_color $bg_color
        done
        echo $(tput sgr0)
    done
tput_colors
tput_colors
